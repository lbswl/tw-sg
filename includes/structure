<h2 id='structure-of-a-document'>Structure of a Document</h2>
<p>Documents are either single-chapter or multi-chapter. The following sections discuss what each type typically contains.</p>
<h3 id='single-chapter-documents'>Single-Chapter Documents</h3>
<p>Documents with a single chapter are usually small (less than 25 pages), or are narrowly focused on a single topic. Examples of such single-chapter documents include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Release Notes</li>
<li>Readme</li>
<li>Simple installation, configuration, or developer documents that are limited to only one focus area or topic</li>
<li>Product notes</li>
<li>White papers</li>
</ul>

<p>For a single-chapter document, ensure you have the following components:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Front Page (or Title Page)</strong>: This contains the official name of the document (or guide), a very short and succinct explanation of what the document is about and a brief description of its audience. It also includes the release month and year.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Every time you make a major update to an existing document, make sure that you create a copy and make changes to it. Update the release date and month accordingly.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A page with ToC</strong>: Always have this if your document is more than five pages. For very short documents, it’s OK to not include the ToC.</li>
<li><strong>An empty second page</strong>: Leave this page empty.</li>
<li><strong>A single Chapter</strong>: The content of this entire document resides in this chapter. This just has a heading, no chapter number.</li>
<li><strong>(Optional) Appendix A</strong>: This contains the additional information related to the content specified in the chapter. It starts from a new page.</li>
<li><strong>(Optional) A Glossary</strong>: This contains the list of important terms that have been used in the document, and a good place to consolidate all the important definitions. It starts from a new page.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id='multi-chapter-documents'>Multi-Chapter Documents</h3>
<p>Any document that is more than 30 pages or covers different aspects related to a topic is typically organized as a multi-chapter document. Most of the documents in the Technical Writing (TW) universe are of this type.</p>

<p>For a multiple-chapter document, ensure you have the following components:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Front Page (or Title Page)</strong>: This contains the official name of the document (or guide), a very short and succinct explanation of what the document is about and a brief description of its audience. It also includes the release month and year.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Every time you make a major update to an existing document, make sure that you create a copy and make changes to it. Update the release date and month accordingly.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A page with ToC</strong>: Always have this, if your document is more than five pages.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:For very short documents (five pages or less), it’s OK to not include the ToC.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>An empty page</strong>: Leave this page empty.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For example</strong>:
<code>wize
Chapter 1: Before You Begin...
</code>
- <strong>Chapter 1</strong>: Typically, the content of overview or introduction to the overall subject matter of the guide is covered in this chapter. This starts from a new page, and has a heading and a chapter number.
- <strong>Chapter 2, 3. 4…</strong>
- <strong>Chapter <em>n</em></strong>: This is the last chapter of the guide or document.
- <strong>(Optional) Appendix A</strong>: This contains the additional information related to the content specified in one of the chapters in the guide or document. It starts from a new page.
- <strong>Appendix B, C, D…</strong>
- <strong>(Optional) Appendix <em>n</em></strong>: This is the final appendix of the guide or the document. It starts from a new page.
- <strong>(Optional) A Glossary</strong>: This contains the list of important terms that have been used in the document, and a good place to consolidate all the important definitions. It starts from a new page.</p>
