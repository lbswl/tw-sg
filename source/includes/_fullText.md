## Structure of a Document {#structure-of-a-document}

Documents are either single-chapter or multi-chapter. The following sections discuss what each type typically contains. 


### Single-Chapter Documents   {#single-chapter-documents}

Documents with a single chapter are usually small (less than 25 pages), or are narrowly focused on a single topic. Examples of such single-chapter documents include: 



*   Release Notes
*   Readme
*   Simple installation, configuration, or developer documents that are limited to only one focus area or topic
*   Product notes
*   White papers 

For a single-chapter document, ensure you have the following components: \




*   **The Front Page (or Title Page): **This contains the official name of the document (or guide), a very short and succinct explanation of what the document is about and a brief description of its audience. It also includes the release month and year. \
**IMPORTANT: **Every time you make a major update to an existing document, make sure that you create a copy and make changes to it. Update the release date and month accordingly. \

*   **A page with ToC: **Always have this if your document is more than five pages. For very short documents, it’s OK to not include the ToC.  \

*   **An empty second page:** Leave this page empty. \

*   **A single Chapter: **The content of this entire document resides in this chapter. This just has a heading, no chapter number. \

*   **(Optional) Appendix A: **This contains the additional information related to the content specified in the chapter. It starts from a new page. \

*   **(Optional) A Glossary: **This contains the list of important terms that have been used in the document, and a good place to consolidate all the important definitions. It starts from a new page.


### Multi-Chapter Documents   {#multi-chapter-documents}

Any document that is more than 30 pages or covers different aspects related to a topic is typically organized as a multi-chapter document. Most of the documents in the Technical Writing (TW) universe are of this type. \


For a multiple-chapter document, ensure you have the following components: \




*   **The Front Page (or Title Page): **This contains the official name of the document (or guide), a very short and succinct explanation of what the document is about and a brief description of its audience. It also includes the release month and year. \
**IMPORTANT: **Every time you make a major update to an existing document, make sure that you create a copy and make changes to it. Update the release date and month accordingly. \

*   **A page with ToC: **Always have this, if your document is more than five pages.  \
For very short documents (five pages or less), it’s OK to not include the ToC.  \

*   **An empty page:** Leave this page empty. \

*   **Chapter 1: **Typically, the content of overview or introduction to the overall subject matter of the guide is covered in this chapter. This starts from a new page, and has a heading and a chapter number. For example: \
Chapter 1: Before You Begin \

*   **Chapter 2, 3. 4…. \
**
*   **Chapter _n_: **This is the last chapter of the guide or document.** \
**
*   **(Optional) Appendix A: **This contains the additional information related to the content specified in one of the chapters in the guide or document. It starts from a new page. \

*   **Appendix B, C, D…. \
**
*   **(Optional) Appendix _n_: **This is the final appendix of the guide or the document. It starts from a new page. \

*   **(Optional) A Glossary: **This contains the list of important terms that have been used in the document, and a good place to consolidate all the important definitions. It starts from a new page.


## Use of Bold, Italics, and Fixed Fonts  {#use-of-bold-italics-and-fixed-fonts}

We typically use **Bold**, _Italics_, and `Fixed Font (`also named` Monospaced Font `or` fixed-pitch)` to highlight a specific word for a definitive reason. The following sections explain when to use which for the maximum effect.


### Bold {#bold}

Use Bold to highlight:



*   **Terms used in the GUI (button names, fields names, menus, radio buttons, checkboxes): **For example: \
Make sure you click the **Create** button to start the process. \
Enter your system’s IP address in the **IP Address** field. \
Select the **Tools** menu.
*   **Terms that are preceded by “:” in bulleted lists: **For example, see the bullets in this list.
*   **Names of packages: **For example: \
Run the `npm install text-cli` command to install the **<code>txt-cli</code></strong> utility.
*   <strong>User input: </strong>For example: \
Enter <strong>10.1.1.1</strong> in the <strong>IP Address</strong> field.

<strong>NOTE: </strong>If a button has an icon instead of text, use a small image of the button in your text. For example:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>When the button only has an icon
   </td>
   <td>Click Close ( *) to close the dialog box.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>When the button has both icon and text
   </td>
   <td>Click Close * to close the dialog box.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


          Click the 

<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of0.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of0.png "image_tooltip")
 button to close the dialog box.


### Italics {#italics}

Italics are typically used to emphasize a word or group of words. For example:

_At least **two**_ Dev reviews are required before you check in your code.

You must _not_ enter the building without your ID card.

**NOTE: **Use this style sparingly. Otherwise you might dilute its “strength”.


### Fixed Font {#fixed-font}

Use this style to highlight the following in your text:



*   **Command or piece of code: **For example: \
Run the `npm install text-cli` command to install the **<code>txt-cli</code></strong> utility.
*   <strong>File or folder names: </strong>For example: \
Read the <code>README.md</code> file before you proceed.


## Acronyms and Abbreviations {#acronyms-and-abbreviations}

In this section, we cover the following style conventions:



*   Acronyms
*   Abbreviations


### Acronyms {#acronyms}

There are two cases of using acronyms in writing:



*   **Spelling them out first and then specifying the acronym.**

    _Always_ spell out an acronym you are using for the first time in a chapter. Chances are your readers might not know what PRD is! For example:


    This section specifies the terms used in a Product Requirement Document (PRD). The most often used terms in a PRD include:

*   …..
*   **Giving out the popular acronyms first and then spelling them out.** \
If an acronym is more familiar than the spelled-out version, you should first specify the acronym, followed by the spelled-out version. For example: \


    You can share your personal URL (Uniform Resource Locator). 


    OR you can use the following method:


    You can share your personal URL, short for Uniform Resource Locator. 


**NOTE:** When specifying plural form of an acronym, do NOT use an apostrophe (‘) before s. HTML’s and CD’s are not the correct plural form of HTML and CD, respectively. HTMLs and CDs are the correct forms.


### Abbreviations {#abbreviations}

_Never _use the following abbreviations in any formal document:



*   eg. \
Instead use for example.
*   etc.  \
Instead give the full list of options. 
*   i.e. \
Instead use in other words or that is.
*   fig. \
Instead spell it out as figure.
*   tbl. \
Instead spell it out as table.
*   pg. \
Instead spell it out as page.

The reason for not using these words is that they are not localization friendly.


## Active and Passive Voice {#active-and-passive-voice}

Always try to write in the active voice, but do not fear the correct, thoughtful use of the passive voice. Writing entirely in the active voice is nearly impossible to achieve, so know when to use the passive voice.

Because technical writers often insist on using the active voice, the following incorrect example appears in documentation:

(WRONG) As soon as the application completes, the following message displays.

(RIGHT) As soon as the application is finished, the following message is displayed.

OR

(RIGHT) When the application finishes, the following message appears.

Know that a message does not “display”. Rather, a message “appears” or “is displayed” by the system. The passive voice can indicate that the subject is the receiver of the action rather than the performer.

Make your writing active by concentrating on the activity of your subject. Use the passive voice when it is unavoidable because the performer of the action is either unimportant to the reader or unidentifiable.


## Capitalization {#capitalization}

The rules of capitalization are the following:



*   (Universally known) Every new sentence starts with a Capital letter. \
This rule also applies to:  ← Lead-in sentence for the bulleted list that follows
    *   Bulleted lists ← Sentence fragment \
**IMPORTANT: **In bulleted lists, _always_ capitalize the first word even if it is a sentence fragment or serves as a continuation of the lead-in sentence. \
As an example, consider the lead-in for this list and the sentence fragments that follow.
    *   Numbered lists ← Sentence fragment
    *   Column headings in tables ← Sentence fragment \

*   The first word after a colon (:) is always capitalized. \
For example, see the bulleted list in section, [Bold](#bold), earlier. \

*   Every heading, table caption, figure caption, column name, or a callout in a figure or table must be in **Title** case.  \
This means, all words _except_ articles (a, an, the) and prepositions (to, from, for, of, on, in, by, and so on) must be capitalized. \
To learn more, pay attention to all the headings in this guide. \
 \
**Exception to the Rule:** If a heading, caption, or callout starts or ends with an article, pronoun, or a preposition, then you will need to capitalize the article, pronoun, or preposition. In the following example, “it” is an object pronoun and needs to be capitalized.  \
For example: When to Use It \

*   Most of the hyphenated words _must_ be in Title case. For example: \
HTTP-Based Connectivity \
Client-Server Communication


### Headings, Captions, and Title Case {#headings-captions-and-title-case}

Headings, figure captions, and table captions _must_ always be in Title case. This is because captions are also considered headings.

Using Title case for headings makes it much easier to differentiate a level-four heading. For example:


#### This is a Heading 3 {#this-is-a-heading-3}

This is the text for H3.


##### This is a Heading 4

This is the text for H4.

Now consider the following example:

**This is a heading 4**

This is the text for H4.

In this example, if the H4 were not bolded, there will be no way to distinguish the heading from text at the first glance, as followsshown below:

This is a heading 4

This is the text for H4.

So, Title case it is! Now, here are the rules for using the Title case:



*   Capitalize all principal words: 
    *   Nouns
    *   Pronouns
    *   Verbs
    *   Adverbs
    *   Adjectives
    *   First and last words, no matter what part of speech they are \
For example, This Is All There Is
    *   Hyphenated compounds \
For example, Up-to-Date Report on Accounts \

*   Do NOT capitalize:
    *   Prepositions (with, to, for, at, on, upon, between)
    *   Conjunctions (and, but, or, nor, for)
    *   Articles (a, an, the)

**Widow Headings and Tables**

A lone heading at the end of the page without the rest of the content is called a Widow heading. For example:



<p id="gdcalert2" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of1.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert3">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of1.png "image_tooltip")


**Figure 1: A Sample Widow Heading**

Widow headings are not allowed because they “divorce” the heading from the content that follows, and the reader must scroll to continue reading. Also, for accessibility reasons, it is recommended to keep the related stuff together.

For the same reasons, if you have a long table and you have, say, two rows on one page and the rest of them on the following page, then it is highly recommended that you introduce hard line breaks (ENTER or RETURN) to move the first two rows to the next page.

**Lead-In Lines**

You _must_ have lead-in lines. They are not a nice-to-have item, but a requirement. This is because they not only create separators between sections and subsections, but most importantly, they set up the context of the upcoming information. 

Here’s what the **Open Solaris Style Guide** has to say on this topic:

_“Contextual cues help readers understand where the information belongs within the larger structure of the document. If you do not provide sufficient context, readers have to figure out how the sections are related. You need to help readers make these associations meaningful. For example, you could indicate to readers that a certain topic is part of a broader topic._

_For instance, to indicate that information under a H3 heading is a subtopic of a H2 heading, you could write the subtopic heading to reflect this relationship. Or, you could include introductory text to this effect._

_If sequential order is important, give readers a sense of what comes before and after a topic. For example, if a complex task is logically divided into several short subtasks or procedures, tell readers what comes before and after each procedure. A list of prerequisites before a procedure and a “Where to Go From Here” section after a procedure would suffice here.”_

In short, lead-ins help the reader create a quick mind map and quickly hook onto the information you are trying to provide.

You must specify a lead-in:



*   After any H1, H2, H3, or H4 heading
*   Before:
    *   Bulleted lists
    *   Numbered lists
    *   Code snippet
    *   Command on a separate line
    *   Example code

Here is a good example of **lead-in for a chapter:**

Lists are used to break out information from the paragraph format and to structure the information into an easier-to-read format. Lists must include at least two items. Be sure that lists are unmistakably lists. You do not want the reader to confuse a list with steps, which denote actions. Use secondary entries only if you cannot avoid them. Complex entries defeat the easy-to-read format of a list.

Use unnumbered (bulleted) lists when the entries are not dependent on the sequence in which you present them. When the entries are dependent on sequence, use numbered lists with numerals and letters to build the hierarchy.

Use running text when you have up to four one-word items that have equal weight and no order. Incorporate the items in a sentence in which the items are separated with serial commas. You can also put the items in a list if you want to call particular attention to the items.

Use lists in the following situations:



*   When you have a list of five or more items
*   When you have a list of two or more items in which any of the items consists of two or more words
*   When you have a list of two or more items in which any of the items is a link 

This chapter covers the following topics:



*   “List Introduction Guidelines”
*   “List Introductions and Verbs”
*   “Capitalizing and Punctuating Lists”
*   “Writing Numbered Lists”
*   “Writing Jump Lists”

As you might have noticed in the preceding example, the lead-in for a chapter gives a quick summary of _everything_ the chapter talks about. It allows the reader to quickly scan through the gist of the chapter and decide whether the chapter contains the information they are looking for. In addition, you also see that at the end of the chapter lead-in, there is a list of topics covered in the chapter. See section, “[Links in the Beginning of a Chapter or a Section](#links-in-the-beginning-of-a-chapter-or-a-section)”, for more information on why this is a good practice to follow.

Here is an example of a very descriptive **lead-in for a section with subsections:**

This section provides information about the use of text and graphical elements, such as section headings, tables, and cross-references. Readers will easily recognize and understand the formats as long as you use the style guidelines consistently throughout your document.

Here is an example of a **short and crisp lead-in for a section with subsections:**

Tables are an ideal format for presenting statistical information or facts that you can structure uniformly. Information that is conceptual or explanatory is best written in a narrative paragraph.

This section covers the following topics:



*   Writing Text for Tables
*   Determining the Type of Table to Use

Here is an example of a **lead-in for a bulleted list:**

The workstation that you purchased comes with the following hardware:



*   System unit
*   Monitor
*   Keyboard and mouse

Here is an example of a **lead-in for numbered list:**

To create a file with the vi editor, you needmust to perform the following basic operations:



1. Start vi.
2. Add text to the file.
3. Write the file to save its contents.
4. Quit vi.

**NOTE: **The lead-in for the preceding numbered list example can be crisper. For example, you can also say:


    To create a file with the vi editor:


## Links in the Beginning of a Chapter or a Section {#links-in-the-beginning-of-a-chapter-or-a-section}

It is a _must_ to have links for the H1s in the beginning of the chapter or a document. This is because it serves the following purposes:



*   Tells the reader that you are going to explain these tasks in detail down the line.
*   Prevents the reader from scrolling unnecessarily through the document. \
Suppose, the reader knows about three tasks, but not much about the fourth, then they can directly land up at that task without having to scroll unnecessarily through a bunch of pages.
*   Fulfills the requirements of Accessibility.  \


The same rules apply to long sections. If your section is short and has subsections, but ends on the same page where it was started, then you do not need to have links to the subsections. However if your section is long, then you need to provide links for the subsection, so that readers can “jump” to the section they really need.


## Guidelines for Using Cross-References {#guidelines-for-using-cross-references}

 

Do _not_ use the words “this link” to refer to an external link. It does not give a clear indication to the user whether the link is to a section in the same chapter, same guide, or same library, unless the user brings the cursor to the link. Also, links must always be indicative where you are leading the reader to.

 \
For example: \
(WRONG) See [this link](http://tysto.com/uk-us-spelling-list.html) for an exhaustive list of British versus American spellings. \


Here are quick guidelines for creating cross-references: \




*   **Cross-references to other chapters and sections in the same guide: \
**
    *   **Cross-reference to another section in the same chapter:** \
For more information on &lt;topic>, see section, “&lt;hyperlink/to/section_name>”. \
For example: \
For more information on creating and managing server instances, see section, “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Managing Instances</span>”. \

    *   **Cross-reference to another chapter:** \
For more information on &lt;topic>, see Chapter 1, “&lt;hyperlink/to/chapter_name>”. \
For example: \
For more information on creating and managing server instances, see Chapter 6, “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Managing Instances</span>”. \

    *   **Cross-reference to a section in another chapter:** \
For more information on <topic>, see section, “&lt;hyperlink/to/section_name>” in Chapter 1. \
For example: \
For more information on creating and managing server instances, see section, “<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Managing Instances</span>”, in Chapter 6. \

*   **Cross-references to tables:** \
For more information on &lt;topic>, see &lt;hyperlink/to/Table_number>. \
For example: \
For more information on parameters to use while creating and managing server instances, see <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Table 17</span>. \

*   **Cross-references to figures:** \
For more information on &lt;topic>, see &lt;hyperlink/to/Figure_number>. \
For example: \
For more information on components of server instances, see <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Figure 29</span>. \

*   **Cross-references to external links: \
**Use one of the following methods to specify a link: \

    *   For more information about &lt;topic>, see &lt;hyperlink/to/the/site>. \
 \
For example: \
For more information about Docker bridge networks, see Use Bridge Networks in Docker. \
OR \

    *   For more information on &lt;topic>, see the following link: \
&lt;hyperlink/to/the/site>. \
 \
For example: \
For an exhaustive list of British versus American spellings, see the following link: \
[http://tysto.com/uk-us-spelling-list.html](http://tysto.com/uk-us-spelling-list.html)

        OR

    *   See the following link for more information on &lt;topic_hyperlink/to/the/site>: \
 \
For example: \
 \

    *   See an [exhaustive list of British versus American spellings](http://tysto.com/uk-us-spelling-list.html) for more information.


## Use of the Article “the” before Plurals {#use-of-the-article-“the”-before-plurals}

Do _not_ use the article “the” before plurals that are not qualified. Why? Because this is a grammar rule! For example: 

(INCORRECT) The administrators belong to the group called **Everyone.**

(CORRECT) Administrators belong to the group called **Everyone.**

However, you will use the article "the" before a plural _when_ you are further describing them. For example:

(CORRECT) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The</span> administrators who belong to the group called **Everyone** can have their rights revoked.


## Use of “If…., then….” Clauses {#use-of-“if…-then…-”-clauses}

Although not a must, the use of “then” in an “If…., then….” construct is highly recommended. Some writing gurus argue that this construct very clearly highlights the **action** (if….) and the **result** (,then ….). Consider this long sentence:

(CONFUSING) If you can fit 10 years into one year, grow 10 years older in one year, and fit 10 years’ worth of meditation in one year, you can easily get enlightenment within one year.

(EASIER TO READ) If you can fit 10 years into one year, grow 10 years older in one year, and fit 10 years’ worth of meditation in one year, **then** you can easily get enlightenment within one year.


## Use of FormattedBolded Punctuation

The following rules describe the use of formatting in punctuations:



*   If the punctuation is related to the whole text and not just the emphasised word, it follows the text style.
*   If the punctuation is related to the specific emphasised word or text, it follows the emphasis style. This case is mostly common in Headings and Captions.

NOTEote: Many machine translators are designed to understand emphasised words as terminology. When the punctuation is formatted, the translator considers it as part of the terminology, and may change the overall context of the sentence.

The following table illustrates some examples:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Text
   </td>
   <td>Comment
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>In the New Project window, select the New Activity option and then click Next.
   </td>
   <td>The period at the end of the sentence represents the end of the sentence and not the word Next, so it is not in Bold.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Figure 1: High Level Architecture of the Platform
   </td>
   <td>The colon after the caption title is an extension of the emphasised text and not the whole text, so it is in Bold.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>You can use Confluence, Open Wiki, or MediaWiki for the product.
   </td>
   <td>The serial commas represent the list of items in the sentence and not each individual item, so it is not in Bold.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


When you bold a part of the sentence (for example to indicate GUI element names or the heading of a bulleted list), make sure that you bold the punctuation that immediately follows the bolded part. For example:

In the New Project window, select the **New Activity** option and then click** Next.**



*   **Cross-reference to figures<span style="text-decoration:underline;">:</span>**


## Use of Other Punctuation with Parentheses

Include full stops (periods), exclamation marks, question marks, or quotation marks

_before_ the closing parentheses _only if_ the complete sentence or quote is in brackets. Otherwise, punctuate _after_ the closing bracket. For example: \


The last bus today is at 4.45 (which is earlier than usual)**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">.</span>** \


The last bus today is at 4.45. (That’s earlier than usual**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">.</span>**)


## Use of Hyphen and Em Dash

Know the difference between a hyphen (-) and an em dash (—):



*   **Hyphen: **It is the smallest dash and is on the Keyboard. It is used to combine words. For example, time-consuming, multi-tasking. \

*   **Em dash:** It is the longest mark of punctuation, and is used to separate information. It is similar to separating information with “, ….,”, but is considered stronger. Also, note that there must be no trailing spaces before or after the em dash. For example: \
Dashes can be used in pairs like parentheses—that is, to enclose a word, or a phrase, or a clause—or they can be used alone to detach one end of a sentence from the main body. \
**TIP: **On your Mac system, you get em dash by pressing SHIFT + OPTION + - keys.

**NOTE:** We also have an en dash (–), which is somewhere between a hyphen and an em dash. It is used to separate numbers (0–9), and can be read as “0 through 9”. (On your Mac system, you get en dash by pressing OPTION + - keys.) However, the difference between - and – is very slight. Therefore, you can use a hyphen to specify number and date ranges.


## Difference between “it’s” and “its” {#difference-between-“it’s”-and-“its”}

This is quite simple, actually. Always remember this simple formula:



*   “It’s” == “ it is” (There are **no exceptions** to this contraction in formal writing.) \
For example: It’s a cold day. == It is a cold day. \

*   “Its” belongs to something (Again, there are **no exceptions** to this rule.) \
For example: Its properties are as follows: == &lt;Something’s> properties are as follows: \
**NOTE: **We used “something” in the example for “its” above, because any kind of “it” refers to non-living objects. Your computers also fall in this non-living category, even when they become as advanced as a Terminator in the future!


## Use of Commas (,) in “and” and “or” Lists {#use-of-commas-in-“and”-and-“or”-lists}

The rules are simple and are as follows:



*   You do _not_ use a comma before the conjunctions “and” and “or” if your list contains **only two items.** For example: \
Any new organization needs to invest in good infrastructure and hiring great talent. \
Could you please lend me a pen or a pencil?
*   You use a comma before the conjunctions “and” and “or” when your list comprises **three or more items.** For example: \
A “Pod” at Wizeline comprises a Project Manager, a Technical Writer, Engineers, and UX designers. \
I can live with option A, B, or C.


## Use of Numbers  {#use-of-numbers}

Remember these rules about numbers:



*   Spell out numbers that are less than 10 (0 - 9).  \
For example: I have seven aunts. \
Only two concurrent connections are allowed for security purposes. \

*   Use numerals for 10 and higher. \
For example: I have 10 cousins. \
This hub has 32 ports.
*   Use a separatorcomma for easy readability for numbers between 1,000 and 999,999higher than 999. \
For example (English UK and US): The university’s network supports up to 10,000 connections. \
Different countries use different symbols for the separator and the decimal. The following list (source: Oracle Docs) illustrates some examples:
    *   Canadian (English and French): 4 294 967 295,000  
    *   Danish: 4 294 967 295,000
    *   Finnish: 4 294 967 295,000
    *   French: 4 294 967 295,000
    *   German: 4 294 967.295,000
    *   Italian: 4.294.967.295,000
    *   Norwegian: 4.294.967.295,000
    *   Spanish: 4.294.967.295,000
    *   Swedish: 4 294 967 295,000
    *   English (UK): 4,294,967,295.00
    *   English (US): 4,294,967,295.00
*   Thai: 4,294,967,295.00  \

*   Use a sub-thousand numeral and the applicable power of 10. \
For example: The application server supports up to 10 million users.  \
NOTE: The power of 10 is used differently in different languages based on the long or the short scale in use. For more information, refer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_10. \

*   Use percentages to depict fractions, if possible. \
For example: The development is 75% complete.  \
Stating that “The development is ¾ complete. ”, is not very helpful.

    **NOTE: **No need to spell out the word “percent”. \
For example: The data center’s Service Level Agreement (SLA) offers 99.9% data availability. 



## Use of Apostrophe (‘) Marks {#use-of-apostrophe-‘-marks}

 Contractions are typically considered informal writing. That is why a lot of Style Guides discourage them. However to avoid “stuffiness” in your writing, go ahead and use an Apostrophe mark for:



*   **Contractions** such as:
    *   Don’t

    **NOTE:** Avoid contractions such as “doesn’t”, “you’ll”, “wouldn’t”, “shouldn’t”, “couldn’t”, “we’ll”. \


*   **Possessions** such as:
    *   User’s
    *   System’s

_Do not_ use an Apostrophe mark for:



*   It’s \
Instead spell it out as it is.
*   Case’s ID \
This is anthropomorphically wrong. 
*   Acronyms’ plurals \
API’s, instead use APIs.  \
LAN’s, instead of LANs.


## Use of Bulleted and Numbered Lists {#use-of-bulleted-and-numbered-lists}

You use **bulleted lists** when the order of the items in the list is _not important_. For example, consider the following case below:

Wizeline Academy conducts courses on:



*   UX
*   Programming 
*   Technical Writing

In the preceding example, the order of the items is interchangeable. As a result, a bulleted list is better suited.

You use **numbered lists** when the sequence of steps _is important_. For example, consider the following case:


    Complete the required prerequisite tasks as follows:



1. Set up the Dow Jones Okta account.
2. Set up the Dow Jones VPN and Certificate on your local computer.
    1. Sign and send the **Vendor Remote Access** form to Dow Jones.
    2. Wait for the access to be approved by Dow Jones.
    3. Contact the Dow Jones **Service Desk** for a setup session over remote access.
    4. People you will need to contact at Dow Jones regarding the setup:
        *   **Milind Joshi:** IT-Director in Dow Jones. He is the main person to contact.
        *   **Mark Thompson:** Technical Lead for the Service Desk.
3. Connect to the Dow Jones VPN.
4. Connect to the Dow Jones VPN and confirm that you can access the Project repository at `Repo/DowJones Jira/Artifactory/Symphony`.

In this procedure, the sequence of the steps cannot be changed by you, because the task you are trying to complete will not work. This is why you use a Numbered list in this case. 

**IMPORTANT: **Make bulleted and numbered lists parallel.

Make sure that headings, bulleted lists, and numbered lists start with the same type of word, as much as possible. Also, make sure that _all_ items in the bulleted and numbered lists either end with no period (.) or all of them end with a period. For example: \
(WRONG Headings) “Style Conventions”, “How to Use Numbers Correctly”, “Using NOTE, TIP, IMPORTANT Messages”. \
(RIGHT Headings) “How to Use Other Style Conventions”, “How to Use Numbers Correctly”, “How to Use NOTE, TIP, IMPORTANT Messages”. \
 \
**TIP: **If using Google Docs, always display the document outline (**View** → **Document outline**) to ensure that headings are parallel.  \
 \
(WRONG Bulleted List) We typically use the following:



                *   Bold fonts.
                *   Italic fonts
                *   Fixed fonts.

(CORRECT Bulleted List) We typically use the following:



                *   Bold fonts
                *   Italic fonts
                *   Fixed fonts

 \
(WRONG Numbered List) To turn on offline access:



1. You must be connected to the Internet.
2. Use the [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) browser.
3. Install and enable [Google Docs offline Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-docs-offline/ghbmnnjooekpmoecnnnilnnbdlolhkhi).

(CORRECT Numbered List) To turn on offline access:



1. Make sure that you are connected to the Internet.
2. Use the [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) browser.
3. Install and enable [Google Docs offline Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-docs-offline/ghbmnnjooekpmoecnnnilnnbdlolhkhi).


## Use of the Pronoun “You” {#use-of-the-pronoun-“you”}

It is very important to address the reader as “you”, irrespective of whether they are an end user, a developer, or an administrator. Never write in third form (for example, Administrators can create and manage other administrators.), unless you are explicitly writing for the users of your readers.


## Use of the Relative Pronouns “That” and “Which” {#use-of-the-relative-pronouns-“that”-and-“which”}

Consider this example and its explanation on [http://www.writersdigest.com/online-editor/which-vs-that](http://www.writersdigest.com/online-editor/which-vs-that). \


_“Our office, which has two lunchrooms, is located in Cincinnati.”_

_“Our office that has two lunchrooms is located in Cincinnati.”_

The preceding two sentences are _not_ the same. The first sentence tells us that you have just one office, and it’s located in Cincinnati. The clause “which” has two lunchrooms gives us additional information, but it doesn’t change the meaning of the sentence. Remove the clause and the location of our one office would still be clear: Our office is located in Cincinnati.

Always use a comma before “which”. If your “which” does not need a comma before, then replace it with “that”. This is because, “that” represents strong information, while which represents weak information. For example:

 \
(WRONG) You must run `npm` on the same instance on which you installed the database.

(RIGHT) You must run `npm` on the same instance where you installed the database. \


(WRONG) Use the system which you instantiated first.

(RIGHT) Use the system that you instantiated first.

(WRONG) For this installation, use the system which you instantiated first.

(RIGHT) For this installation, use the first system, which you instantiated in the beginning. \


**Use of “That” in Clauses**

As wonderfully stated in the IBM Style Guide:

_“Do not omit the word that from clauses. The use of the conjunction that, although technically optional in some sentences, is never wrong and makes the sentence easier to translate and clearer for readers whose primary language is not English.” _

For example: 

(WRONG) Verify your directory service is working.

(RIGHT)  Verify that your directory service is working.

(WRONG) This chapter provides the information you need to install the software. 

(RIGHT) This chapter provides the information that you must install the software. 

**Use of Commas and Verbs in Coordinate Clauses**

When you write a sentence that includes two Coordinate clauses, do _not omit_: \
 \
**NOTE:** According to Merriam Webster, _“ a Coordinate clause is one of two or more **clauses** in a sentence that are of equal importance and usually joined by and, or, or but.”_ \




*   The comma (,) after the first clause’s verb. 
*   The verb in the second clause. 

For example: \
(WRONG) The file names are displayed in uppercase characters and the other file attributes in lowercase characters.

(RIGHT) The file names are displayed in uppercase characters<span style="text-decoration:underline;">,</span> and the other file attributes <span style="text-decoration:underline;">are displayed</span> in lowercase characters.

**Use of the Nouns “Client” and “Customer”**

Use the word “customer” to refer to Wizeline customers, such as Dow Jones, Nat Geo, and such. Do _not_ use the word “client” if you mean “customer”. However, use the word “client” for computer clients (in keeping with Client/Server architecture.)


## Use of Compound Modifiers {#use-of-compound-modifiers}

As Grammarly describes, _“a compound modifier consists of two words connected by a [hyphen](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/hyphen/), which act together like one adjective.”_ For example, time-consuming task, load-balancing system, or schedule-based tasks.

**TIP: **Words with “consuming” or “based” are almost always hyphenated.

Both adjectives that make up the compound modifier are _always_ singular. You never express them as plurals. Only the noun that they modify can be expressed as plural For example: \
 \
(RIGHT) a five-storey building, a seven-year-old practice \
(WRONG) five-storey<span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span> building, seven-year<span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>-old practice \
(RIGHT) five-storey building<span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>, seven-year-old practice<span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>

However, if the sentence ends with a compound modifier, you do _not_ hyphenate it. For example: \
 \
Be aware that setting up a load balancer is time consuming.

If you have multiple words with same compound modifier, then you do not need to repeat the part after hyphen. For example:

Setting up a load balancer is a time- and effort-consuming task.

**NOTE: **Do not use a hyphen, when one of the words is an adverb that ends in “-ly”. For example, "easily duplicated error" will not be hyphenated.


## Use of NOTE, TIP, and IMPORTANT Messages {#use-of-note-tip-and-important-messages}

NOTE, TIP, and IMPORTANT messages are a great way to convey special information to the reader. The following table explains when to use each.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Message Type</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>When to Use It</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>NOTE:</strong>
   </td>
   <td>Use it to convey extra or related information that could be useful for the reader.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>TIP:</strong>
   </td>
   <td>Use it to specify an alternate way of doing a task or to provide useful information that helps one complete a task faster.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> 
   </td>
   <td>Use it to highlight important information, without which the user task might fail.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


If you need to include one of the preceding messages in a bulleted list or a numbered list, make sure that it is aligned with the bulleted or numbered item. For example:



1. Make sure you have the correct versions of Node and NPM before the installation:
    *   **Node version:** v4.4.7
    *   **NPM version:** :2.15.8

        **TIP:** It is recommended that you install `nvm` so that you can easily switch between multiple versions of Node.

## Accessibility Rules to Keep in Mind While Writing {#accessibility-rules-to-keep-in-mind-while-writing}

Accessibility is the successful access to information technology and its supporting documentation by people who have disabilities, such as people with visual impairments and people who cannot use a traditional keyboard. When you design or modify information to allow access by the greatest number of people, you make it accessible. 

Here are the basic Accessibility rules for writing documentation: \




1. Write **clear instructions.** This includes:
    *   Clear, short, and concise sentences
    *   Important information first
    *   Parallel writing
    *   Complete words for "/", "&", "+", "-", "~"
    *   Meaningful alternative text for images \

2. Describe the location of visual elements on the screen. For example: \
On the top-right corner of the window, click the **Password Preferences** option. \
From the menu on the left side of the window, select **Regions.** \

3. Specify a clear and concise description for all images (figures) and tables. For example: \
The following pie chart illustrates the percentage of sales across different geographical regions of the world. \


<p id="gdcalert3" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Copy-of2.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert4">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/Copy-of2.png "image_tooltip")
 \
 \
            **Figure: Sales Percentages Across Different Regions of the World** \
 \
In the preceding figure, the pie chart illustrates that sales across North America are 45%;  across Asia Pacific are 30%, across Europe are 17%, and across Latin America are 8%. \
 \
The following table describes the folder structure you see for Banner. It lists all the main folders and files related to Banner. \
&lt;Table>  \

4. Document all alternate methods of interaction and input. These include input commands and keyboard shortcuts. For example: \
To capture a screenshot on your Mac system, use the Photos application. \
**NOTE: **You can also press the COMMAND + SHIFT + 4 keys together to take a screenshot. Note that this screenshot is by default saved on the Desktop. \
 \
**NOTE: **You always use all caps for keyboard keys. So, ENTER, RETURN, ESC, SHIFT, DELETE, ALT, FN, CONTROL, OPTION, COMMAND, TAB, and other key names _must_ always be all caps. It is a standard notation in technical writing world and makes it very easy for the reader to know that these are Keyboard keys.  \

5. Avoid the use of just color to highlight text. \
**NOTE: **Typically, you have a corresponding icon to go with NOTE, TIP, or IMPORTANT. But because we use Markdown a lot, use them all caps and bolded to highlight their importance. In a Google Doc, they can serve as visual cues with extra color. \

6. Avoid red and green in images. \

7. Avoid hard-to-read color combinations in images. \

8. Avoid using filters for photo effects while creating images. \

9. Avoid shaded backgrounds, watermarks, or images in the text background. \

10. Ensure that you document elements on the screen and links follow the correct order while documenting. 


## Internationalization Rules to Keep in Mind While Writing {#internationalization-rules-to-keep-in-mind-while-writing}

Internationalization means writing for international, sometimes non-native English audience. This means, that you are “writing for translation”. As a result, your writing should be bias-, jargon-, local humor-, idiom-, irony-, metaphor-, and slang-free. 

**IMPORTANT: **Remember that documentation that is written in English is often distributed worldwide.

Here are some things you must always keep in mind while writing:



*   **Use American spelling and punctuation.** This is because this is widely accepted as the standard of writing. Therefore, although the original (British) spelling is colour, humour, neighbour, organise, organisation, aeroplane, and analyse, the Americanized versions are color, humor, neighbor, organize, organization, airplane, and analyze, respectively.  \
See the following link for an exhaustive list of British versus American spellings: \
[http://tysto.com/uk-us-spelling-list.html](http://tysto.com/uk-us-spelling-list.html)** \
**
*   **Use terms consistently. **As far as possible, use the same term for a specific word throughout the document. For example, do not use “appears”, “shows”, or “displays” interchangeably.

    For example: \
4. Click the **Next** button to continue with the installation. \
     The Configure Your Server Instance dialog box appears. \
 \
In this example, use “appears” consistently. Do _not_ do this: \
4. Click the **Next** button to continue with the installation. \
    The Configure Your Server Instance dialog box appears. \
5. Follow the instructions shown by the dialog box, and click the **Next** button. \
    The Configure the Load Balancer dialog box displays. \


*   **Use uppercase and lowercase consistently in case of similar elements. **Using consistent case helps your reader _and_ the translator determine the proper interpretation of a term.  \
**IMPORTANT:** The use of consistent case is significant for reserved keywords, class names, and variables. \

*   **Avoid masculine (or even feminine) pronouns.** Do not use “he”, “she”, “he/she”, or “s/he”. Ever! Instead rewrite the sentence to use “you”. The easiest, best, and most fool-proof approach is to convert the sentence to plural form (“they”, “their”, and “them”). For example: \
(WRONG) To log in, the user must enter his login name and password. \
(RIGHT) To log in, enter your login name and password. \
OR \
(RIGHT) To log in, users must enter their login names and passwords. \

*   **Use ISO standards for Date and Time.** Date and time formats differ around the world. For example, here are the different ways dates are represented around the world:
    *   **Month, day, year.** Used mainly in the United States.
    *   **Day, month, year. **Used in Europe.
    *   **Year, month, day. **Used in Asia.  \


    To avoid confusion, use the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard for numeric representation of dates, which follows **YYYY-MM-DD** format. \
 \
Time format also differs around the world. For example:

    *   **12-hour system with AM and PM**
    *   **24-hour system**

     \
To avoid confusion, use the 24-hour system, _without_ AM or PM. For example, use 13:00 to indicate 1 PM.  \


*   **Make sure you specify telephone numbers in the correct format. **The correct format is **+ CC CyC NNNNNN, _without_ the dashes (–).** Here, CC represents Country Code, CyC represents City Code, and NNNNNN represents the actual telephone number. The length of this number can vary depending on the local number and whether it is a desk phone number or cell phone number.
*   **Use only the International System of Units (SI) symbols to express the units of values of quantities.** The following table lists the most frequently used units: \


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>
<strong>Quantity</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Unit</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Symbol</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Length
   </td>
   <td>meter
   </td>
   <td>m
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Mass
   </td>
   <td>kilogram
   </td>
   <td>kg
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Time
   </td>
   <td>second
   </td>
   <td>s
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Electric Current
   </td>
   <td>ampere
   </td>
   <td>A
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



     \
See the following link for the recommended list of SI units and their symbols: \
[https://www.nist.gov/pml/nist-guide-si-chapter-4-two-classes-si-units-and-si-prefixes](https://www.nist.gov/pml/nist-guide-si-chapter-4-two-classes-si-units-and-si-prefixes) 


     \
**NOTE:** Although not SI-approved, use **min** and **hr** to indicate minutes and hours, respectively. As per the preceding table, seconds are written as **s.** \
 \
You _must_ use a space between the quantity and the symbol. However, _never_ add a period (.) after the unit. Also, do _not_ add an “s” after the symbol to indicate it as plural; units are _always_ singular. For example: \
The length of the cable is 4.6 m long. \
An iPad mini weighs 1.08 kg. 



*   **Make sure your writing is culturally neutral. **Do not use jargons, slang, idiom, or humor. These are, typically, very difficult to translate. \

*   **Avoid references to culturally-sensitive events.** Do not use religious, historical, or political examples or references in your technical documentation. In addition to being culturally insensitive, your readers might not understand them or relate to them. \

*   **Show inclusion and diversity in diagrams and figures.** If depicting people, show people of different gender, age, race, and professions in your diagrams.  \

*   **Know that text expansion can occur when a document is translated.** A document can increase in size by up to 25%, which can substantially expand the length of your document. For example, German words are typically longer than their English counterparts. \

*   **Make sure that your documents have been reviewed by a peer or more experienced person. **This will help you eliminate basic errors such as typos and inconsistent term usage that cause a lot of trouble during translation.

[Don'ts](#heading=h.dshgjr9dzzac) that you need to keep in mind while writing. 


### Dos

Always remember the following: \




*   **Make the subject of a sentence clear.** For example: \
(WRONG) If the completed field has text, it does not change. \
(RIGHT) If the completed field has text, that text does not change. \
 \
(WRONG) This can prevent you from completing the process successfully.  \
(RIGHT) This restriction can prevent you from completing the process successfully. \
 \
(WRONG) Ensure that you apply the fix packs to the servers and applications. These are critical to ensuring that your system does not fail. \
(RIGHT) Ensure that you apply the fix packs to the servers and applications. These fix packs are critical to ensuring that your system does not fail. 
*   **Use “you” instead of “the user”, if writing user-facing document.** For example: \
You must complete these prerequisite tasks before you install Symphony and NewsPlus. \
Install the `npm` module. \
**NOTE: **In the sentence, Install the `npm` module, you is hidden. But the meaning is still conveyed that “you” are installing the module. \

*   **Use crisp sentences, and avoid redundant and unnecessary phrases. **For more information on words and phrases to avoid and their replacements, see “[Appendix A: Words and Phrases to Avoid](#appendix-a-words-and-phrases-to-avoid)”.** \
**
*   **Make headings, lists, steps, and sentences parallel as much as possible.** For example: \
(WRONG) Restoring the Operating System, Disaster Recovery With Autochanger, Recovery With a Stand-alone Drive \
(RIGHT) Operating System Disaster Recovery, Autochanger Disaster Recovery, Stand-alone Drive Disaster Recovery \
** **
*   **Avoid the use of he or she.** For example: \
(WRONG) The administrator is responsible for this task. Contact him at [admin@example.com](mailto:admin@wl.com). \
(WRONG) The administrator is responsible for this task. Contact him or her at [admin@example.com](mailto:admin@wl.com). \
(RIGHT) The administrator is responsible for this task. Contact **them** at [admin@example.com](mailto:admin@wl.com). \

*   **Avoid the use of “&”, when you mean “and”.** This applies to headings as well as normal text. \
(WRONG) Establishing & Testing the Connection. \
(RIGHT) Establishing and Testing the Connection. \

*   **Avoid using words like “shall”, could”, and “would”.** Rephrase if these words appear in your document. For example: \
(WRONG) You would have to complete these steps, before you proceed any further. \
(RIGHT) Complete these steps before you proceed any further. \

*   **Keep the audience type in mind while writing.** You will need to use the language that your audience relates to. For example, in a Linux-based instruction, using “folder” is not accurate.  \
Similarly, if your audience is administrators, you must not explain every small thing they might already know. They will not read your document! \

*   **While making recommendations, use “Wizeline recommends”.** _Do not_ use “it is recommended” or “we recommend”. \

*   **Use the same order. **When you have a list of ideas, components, features, and items, make sure you follow the same order that you used the first time. If you are not happy with order, change the order in the first instance and use the changed order consistently. For example: \
**Specifications, Lifecycle, and State** ← A Heading \
(WRONG) The instructions in this section explain how to use <span style="text-decoration:underline;">states, lifecycle methods, and specifications </span>when you want your component to do a specific task. \
(RIGHT) The instructions in this section explain how to use specifications, lifecycle methods, and states when you want your component to do a specific task. \

*   **Watch out for long sentences.** If your sentence has more than, say 25 words, break the sentence in two. For example: \
(TOO LONG) Long, wordy sentences are cumbersome to read and comprehend; and by the time the reader reaches the end of the sentence, they tend to forget what was stated in the beginning.  \
(BETTER) Long, wordy sentences are cumbersome to read and comprehend. This is because, by the time the reader reaches the end of the sentence, they tend to forget what was stated in the beginning.  \

*   **Use the simplest terms possible to convey the intended meaning.** For example, use large instead of _voluminous_, and use small instead of _diminutive._ \

*   **Use correct and consistent terminology. \
**
*   **Avoid terms that can be misinterpreted.** For example, use “once” to mean one time, not to mean “after” or “when”. Similarly, use “since” to mean passage of time, not as a synonym of “because”. \

*   **Avoid negative constructions.** For example: \
(WRONG) You cannot reconnect to the server without restarting your computer. \
(RIGHT) To reconnect to the server, restart your computer. \
OR \
(RIGHT) Restart your computer to reconnect to the server. \

*   **Avoid ambiguous headings.** Such headings do not convey meaningful information. For example, the following headings are incomplete: \
(WRONG) “Overview”, “Introduction”, “Front Panel”, “Authentication” \
(RIGHT) “Overview of ….”, “Introduction to &lt;Something>”, “Features of Front Panel”, “Configuring Authentication Options” \

*   **Use a period (.) at the end of an email ID or a link if your sentence ends with an email ID or link. **For example: \
(WRONG) For more information, contact Wizeline at [contact@wizeline.com](mailto:contact@wizeline.com) \
(RIGHT) For more information, contact Wizeline at [contact@wizeline.com](mailto:contact@wizeline.com)**. \
 \
**(WRONG) For more information, visit us at [http://www.wizeline.com](http://www.wizeline.com) \
(RIGHT) For more information, visit us at [http://www.wizeline.com](http://www.wizeline.com). \
(BETTER) For more information, visit us at the following link: \
[http://www.wizeline.com](http://www.wizeline.com) \
 \
 \
 \



### Don’ts

Remember the following tips: \




*   **Do_ not_ use shortened words. **Spell them out completely. For example: \
(WRONG) doc, app, repo \
(RIGHT) document, application, repository \

*   **Do _not_ use “/” to mean “or”.** It is lazy writing. However, if it is a technical term such as “client/server communication”, you can use /. For example: \
(WRONG) You can choose option A/B.  \
(RIGHT) You can choose Option A or B. \

*   **Do _not_ create new terms.** \

*   **Do _not_ use “please” and “thanks”_._ **You need authoritative tone while specifying instructions. However, terms of politeness convey that you are not confident in your information. Also, these terms are not regarded the same way in all cultures.  \

*   **Do _not_ start a sentence with “There are….”. **This is because “There are…” is another ambiguous phrase. For example: \
(WRONG) There are five phases in the lifecycle of the server. \
(RIGHT) The server’s lifecycle comprises five phases. \
OR \
(RIGHT) The server’s lifecycle consists of five phases. \
 \
(WRONG) There are different types of technical documents. \
(RIGHT) Many different types of technical documents exist. \
 \
**IMPORTANT: **Do _not_ use “of” after “comprises” or “comprise”. It’s incorrect.


## How to Do a Self-Review of Your Document {#how-to-do-a-self-review-of-your-document}

**TIP:_ Do not _**start to review your work immediately after completing it. There must be a sufficient gap of 8-24 hours before you review. It enablesallows you to disengage from your work.

Follow these steps to review your own work:



1. Read the complete document _after_ 8-24 hours, _without_ making changes for the first time.
2. Now start to read again and make changes as you go.
3. After the first round of changes, wait for another 8-24 hours and then re-read the changed document to make sure everything reads fine and that you have not introduced any new errors while making changes. \
 \
Now, your document is ready to see the light of the day!

## Appendix B: When in Doubt

Trying to keep the Style Guide short and concise (and therefore usable), you might not find all the answers in this document. If that’s the case, here’s what we suggest you to do:



*   Ask your question in **#sg_forum.**
*   (If you are _not_ a Technical Writer) Ask your question in **#tech-writing.**
*   Refer to the following resources if you are interested in researching on your own:
    *   [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)
    *   [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/frontmatter/toc.html)

    **IMPORTANT:** Don’t forget to contact Meeta with your findings, so that she can update the Style Guide.
