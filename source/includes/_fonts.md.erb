# Use of Bold, Italics, and Fixed Fonts

We typically use **Bold**, _Italics_, and `Fixed Font` (also named `Monospaced Font` or `fixed-pitch`) to highlight a specific word for a definitive reason. The following sections explain when to use which for the maximum effect.

## Bold {#bold}

Use Bold to highlight:

> For example:
```
- Make sure you click the **Create** button to start the process.
- Enter your system’s IP address in the **IP Address** field.
- Select the **Tools** menu.
```

Terms used in the GUI (button names, fields names, menus, radio buttons, checkboxes)

- **Terms that are preceded by “:” in bulleted lists: **For example, see the bullets in this list.
- **Names of packages: **For example: \
Run the `npm install text-cli` command to install the **<code>txt-cli</code></strong> utility.
- <strong>User input: </strong>For example: \
Enter <strong>10.1.1.1</strong> in the <strong>IP Address</strong> field.

<strong>NOTE: </strong>If a button has an icon instead of text, use a small image of the button in your text. For example:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>When the button only has an icon
   </td>
   <td>Click Close ( *) to close the dialog box.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>When the button has both icon and text
   </td>
   <td>Click Close * to close the dialog box.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Italics {#italics}

Italics are typically used to emphasize a word or group of words. For example:

_At least **two**_ Dev reviews are required before you check in your code.

You must _not_ enter the building without your ID card.

**NOTE: **Use this style sparingly. Otherwise you might dilute its “strength”.


### Fixed Font {#fixed-font}

Use this style to highlight the following in your text:



*   **Command or piece of code: **For example: \
Run the `npm install text-cli` command to install the **<code>txt-cli</code></strong> utility.
*   <strong>File or folder names: </strong>For example: \
Read the <code>README.md</code> file before you proceed.
