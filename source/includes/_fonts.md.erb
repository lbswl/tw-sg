# Use of Bold, Italics, and Fixed Fonts

We typically use **Bold**, _Italics_, and `Fixed Font` (also named `Monospaced Font` or `fixed-pitch`) to highlight a specific word for a definitive reason. The following sections explain when to use which for the maximum effect.

## Bold

Use Bold to highlight:

- **Terms used in the GUI** (button names, fields names, menus, radio buttons, checkboxes): For example,
  - Make sure you click the **Create** button to start the process.
  - Enter your system’s IP address in the **IP Address** field.
  - Select the **Tools** menu.
- **Terms that are preceded by “:” in bulleted lists**: For example, see the bullets in this list.
- **Names of packages**: For example,
  Run the `npm install text-cli` command to install the **`txt-cli`** utility.
- **User input**: For example,
  Enter **10.1.1.1** in the **IP Address** field.
- **Special cases of UI Elements**: If a button has an icon instead of text, use a small image of the button in your text. For example,

|Situation|Example|
|:---|:---|
|**When the button only has an icon**|Click **Close** (<img src="includes/images/closeIcon.png" alt="close icon" style="width:3%;"/>) to close the dialog box.|
|**When the button has both icon and text**|Click **Close** <img src="includes/images/closeIcon.png" alt="close icon" style="width:3%;"/> to close the dialog box.|

## Italics

> **NOTE**: Use this style sparingly. Otherwise you might dilute its “strength”.

Italics are typically used to emphasize a word or group of words. For example.

- _At least **two**_ Dev reviews are required before you check in your code.
- You must _not_ enter the building without your ID card.

## Fixed Font

Use a `monospaced font` style to highlight the following in your text:

- **Command or piece of code**: For example,
  - Run the `npm install text-cli` command to install the **`txt-cli`** utility.
- **File or folder names**: For example,
  - Read the `README.md` file before you proceed.
