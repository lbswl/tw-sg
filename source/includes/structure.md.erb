## Structure of a Document

Documents are either single-chapter or multi-chapter. The following sections discuss what each type typically contains.

### Single-Chapter Documents

Documents with a single chapter are usually small (less than 25 pages), or are narrowly focused on a single topic. Examples of such single-chapter documents include:

- Release Notes
- Readme
- Simple installation, configuration, or developer documents that are limited to only one focus area or topic
- Product notes
- White papers

For a single-chapter document, ensure you have the following components:

- **The Front Page (or Title Page)**: This contains the official name of the document (or guide), a very short and succinct explanation of what the document is about and a brief description of its audience. It also includes the release month and year.

> **IMPORTANT**: Every time you make a major update to an existing document, make sure that you create a copy and make changes to it. Update the release date and month accordingly.

- **A page with ToC**: Always have this if your document is more than five pages. For very short documents, it’s OK to not include the ToC.
- **An empty second page**: Leave this page empty.
- **A single Chapter**: The content of this entire document resides in this chapter. This just has a heading, no chapter number.
- **(Optional) Appendix A**: This contains the additional information related to the content specified in the chapter. It starts from a new page.
- **(Optional) A Glossary**: This contains the list of important terms that have been used in the document, and a good place to consolidate all the important definitions. It starts from a new page.

### Multi-Chapter Documents

Any document that is more than 30 pages or covers different aspects related to a topic is typically organized as a multi-chapter document. Most of the documents in the Technical Writing (TW) universe are of this type.

For a multiple-chapter document, ensure you have the following components:

- **The Front Page (or Title Page)**: This contains the official name of the document (or guide), a very short and succinct explanation of what the document is about and a brief description of its audience. It also includes the release month and year.

> **IMPORTANT**: Every time you make a major update to an existing document, make sure that you create a copy and make changes to it. Update the release date and month accordingly.

- **A page with ToC**: Always have this, if your document is more than five pages.

> **NOTE**:For very short documents (five pages or less), it’s OK to not include the ToC.

- **An empty page**: Leave this page empty.
- **Chapter 1**: Typically, the content of overview or introduction to the overall subject matter of the guide is covered in this chapter. This starts from a new page, and has a heading and a chapter number.

> **For example**:

```shell
Chapter 1: Before You Begin...
```

- **Chapter 2, 3. 4…**
- **Chapter _n_**: This is the last chapter of the guide or document.
- **(Optional) Appendix A**: This contains the additional information related to the content specified in one of the chapters in the guide or document. It starts from a new page.
- **Appendix B, C, D…**
- **(Optional) Appendix _n_**: This is the final appendix of the guide or the document. It starts from a new page.
- **(Optional) A Glossary**: This contains the list of important terms that have been used in the document, and a good place to consolidate all the important definitions. It starts from a new page.
